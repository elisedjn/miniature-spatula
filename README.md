This project is a code challenge for Marley Spoon. It took me 4 hours to complete it.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

Then, build the project :

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Then, run the project locally :

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run the tests, you can run :

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

## Stack used

For this project, I decided to use :

- React
- NextJs
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS (and some help of Tailwind UI as well)
- Jest for testing

## Improvements

With more time, I would :

- add more tests
- handle alerts with a built-in component instead of alert()
- automatically redirect to '/' if the user tries to go to '/user-details' but has no selected recipes
- automatically redirect to '/' if the user tries to go to '/confirmation'

If I had to redo it from start:

- I would have prioritized my actions differently, working on a MVP that handle all the basic functionnalities and not focusing on one page at a time,
- I would have spend less time on design and more time on testing
- I would commit more, with smaller changes at every commit

**Let me know if you have any further question!**
